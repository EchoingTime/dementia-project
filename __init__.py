Description:

Machine learning in medicine: Classification and prediction of dementia by support vector machines (SVM) is a study
exploring the use of support vector machines for predicting dementia from a longitudinal group of 150 subjects aged 60
to 96, including 373 subjects with MRI data. This study focuses on using machine learning algorithms to ease the
medical industry with the collection of medical data, which in this case uses machine learning algorithms to predict
dementia and check on possible dementia progress.

Objective:

To apply data mining techniques to the dementia data set and draw connections, e.g., age related to dementia,
by extracting useful and relevant information.

Preliminary Research Questions:

1) Conduct data cleaning of the Dementia dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting
inconsistencies.

2) Understanding risk factors with data clustering by revealing risk factors among patients in similar clusters and
helping to identify the potential progress of dementia.

3) Using association rules for patient segmentation can encounter existing relationships and patterns among patients with
related conditions.

4) Construct a decision tree to categorize data by predicting the possibility of a patient developing dementia based on
clinical and demographic data.
